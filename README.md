# algorithms_study_plans
This repo will contain notebooks for algorithm I, II, and III from https://leetcode.com/study-plan/algorithm/

For now, I'll slowly grow a single NB. However, I will likely only have 6-10 problems per notebook to prevent them from being too long and unreadable. 

NBs will contain detailed explainations as I work through the problems, as well as any corrections or more sophisticated solutions I found working with the group or online.
